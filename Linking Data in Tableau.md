## Scenario
Imagine you're working as a data analyst at a policy research institute. For your current project, you need to create a visualization that shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You need to provide a visual presentation that only allows someone to visually compare CO2 emissions bgetween countries from year to year, but also provides information about each country's population, GDP, and energy use.

You already have a dataset that includes emissions for each country between the years 1960-2011. But, the information that you need on energy use, total population, and GDP you had to collect from a government website. Each dataset is in a separate file. Moreover, some of the information is missing for some countries.

Often you will work with datasets that are missing information. Whether or not you need to find this missing information will depend o your project. In this case, you'll notice that the missing information is from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

Luckily, your project is only concerned with the data from 2000-2011. You need an efficient way to utilize some data from one source, and some data from other sources. Taking just the information that you need from each source and creating a new data source takes a lot of time.
