Used the provided dashboard starter template and dataset to build a basic Tableau dashboard

The default dashboard size was for phone. Had to add a desktop view, then ultimately adjust the size to be able to comfortably fit both sheets' visualizations into the dashboard.

Ended up removing the upper size limit to allow it to automatically fit the screen.

Update:
The next exercise walked through the steps for arranging it in the default layout.
